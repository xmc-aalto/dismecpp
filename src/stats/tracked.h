     * \brief A base class to be used for all types that implement some for of statistics tracking
     * \details Provides the protected methods `record()`, `declare_stat()`, and `make_timer()` that
     * relay the corresponding action to the underlying `stats::StatisticsCollection`, to deriving classes.
     * Publicly available is only the option to register a `Statistics` object for a given statistics name,
     * via `register_stat()`, and read-only access to the accumulator.
     *
     * The implementation of Tracked is a bit tricky because it is trying to achieve too things:
     *   - Since this is expected to be used as base class in many fundamental types of the library, we want to
     *   keep the include dependencies as little as possible. In order to define the interface, it is not necessary
     *   to know any details of the statistics gathering implementation.
     *   - Introduce as little overhead as possible. This is only relevant to the statistics gathering functions
     *   `record()` and `make_timer()` which will appear in performance-critical code. For that reason, they are defined
     *   inline.
     *
     * These two goals are at odds in a naive implementation: In order to define an inline function, we cannot have an
     * incomplete type that is accessed or returned. This is circumvented by defining these functions as templates,
     * in such a way that the problematic call is (nominally) dependent on one of the template parameters, and thus
     * the types only need be available when the function is actually called. This means that the `collection.h`
     * and `timer.h` headers need only be included in the implementation files.
     *
     * Note that this class is non-virtual. It is used as a convenient way of adding functionality to other types. It
     * adds very convenient protected and public member functions. Its destructor is defined protected, so that one
     * does not accidentally try to use it polymorphically.

         * collect all sub-objects during the setup phase, and do the merging after the threads have finished, without
         * worrying about the lifetime of the involved objects.
         * If we were to merge as each thread finishes and we are sure the objects are still alive, the
         * (possibly costly) merging process would need to be mutex protected.
