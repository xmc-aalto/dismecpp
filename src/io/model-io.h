/*! \page model-data Model data format
 *  Models are saved in multiple files. One file contains metadata, whereas the weights are stored in separate files.
 *  We support multiple formats for storing the weights, but the metadata file has always the same structure.
 *
 *  \section model-data-meta Metadata File
 *  The metadata is saved as json. It contains the following keys
 *   - `"num-features"`: Number of features, i.e. the size of a single weight vector
 *   - `"num-labels"`: Number of labels, i.e. the number of weight vectors.
 *   - `"date"`: Contains the data and time when the file was created.
 *   - `"weights"`: Contains info on where the weights are stored. This is an array of dicts, where each entry
 *   corresponds to one weights file. Each weights file stores a contiguous subset (as seen over labels) of the weights.
 *   Each entry into the vector has the keys `"first"`, which is the index of the first label in the file, `"count"`
 *   which is the number of weight vectors, `"file"` which is the file name relative to the metadata file and
 *   `"weight-format"`, which specifies the format in which the weights are saved.
 *
 *   There are several advantages to allowing the weights to be distributed over multiple files. For one, it allows
 *   partial saves, e.g. if one wants to do checkpointing. While this could be achieved by simply appending for the
 *   human-readable text formats, it may require rewriting the entire file in other settings, e.g. when using compressed
 *   files.
 *   Secondly, in a distributed setting with a shared, networked file system, we can reduce the amount of data transfer.
 *   In distributed training, each worker can save its own weight files, and the main program only needs to be notified
 *   that it should update the metadata file. In distributed prediction, each worker only needs to load the weights
 *   for the labels it is responsible for, and does not have to parse the entire weight file only to discard most of
 *   the weights.
 *
 *   I am planning to add the following additional metadata:
 *    - version: To specify which version of the library was used when creating the file
 *    - training: A dict which contains information about the training process
 *    - custom: Guaranteed to never be written by the library, so save to use for others.
 *
 *  \section model-data-dense-txt Dense Text Format
 *  Writes all the weights as space-separated numbers. Each line in the file corresponds to a single weight vector.
 *  Note that this means that the *rows* in the text file correspond to the *columns* in the weight matrix. This is
 *  to make it easier to read only a subset of weight vectors from the text file.
 *
 *  Writing is implemented in \ref io::model::save_dense_weights_txt(), and reading in
 *  \ref io::model::load_dense_weights_txt()
 *
 *  The advantage of this format is that it is human readable and very portable. However, it is not efficient
 *  both in terms of storage and in terms of read/write performance. This can be influenced to some degree
 *  by setting adjusting the precision, i.e. the number of digits written.
 *
 *  \section model-data-sparse-txt Sparse Text Format
 *  Writes all the weights exceeding a given threshold in a sparse format. Each row corresponds to one weight vector,
 *  and consists of `index:value` pairs separated by whitespace. Here, index is the 0-based position in the weight
 *  vector and value its corresponding value.
 *
 *  This format is human readable and portable, and may be much more space efficient than the dense text format. Storage
 *  requirements can be adjusted by setting the precision with which the nonzero weights are written, and by setting
 *  the threshold below which weights are culled.
 *
 *  Writing is implemented in \ref io::model::save_as_sparse_weights_txt(), which can also save dense models by culling
 *  weights below a specified threshold. Reading is implemented through \ref io::model::load_sparse_weights_txt().
 *
 *  \section model-data-dense-npy Dense Numpy Format
 *  Writes the weights as a matrix to a `.npy` file. The data is written in row-major
 *  format to allow loading a subset of the labels by reading contiguous parts of the file.
 *  Since the output is binary, we operate directly on a stream-buffer here.
 *
 *  This format is more space efficient than the text format, and also has much lower computational overhead, since it
 *  does not require any number parsing or formatting. As a rough estimate, for eurlex (~20M weights) saving as (dense)
 *  text takes about 8.8 seconds; as npy it takes only about 200 ms. The file size decreases from 230 MB to 80 MB.
 *  Similar (though slightly less) speedups appear for loading the model.
 *
 *  Writing is implemented in \ref io::model::save_dense_weights_npy() and reading is done using
 *  \ref io::model::load_dense_weights_npy.

         * case, the `save_model` function is not suitable, and this class has to be used.
         *
         * The work flow looks like this: First, a model saver instance is created. You can pass in the name
         * of the metadata file, and additional options as \ref SaveOption.
         * \code
         * SaveOption options;
         * PartialModelSaver saver(target_file, options)
         * \endcode
         * Then the partial models will be added. The first model will be used to determine the total number of
         * labels and features, and all further partial models added will be verified to be compatible. Note that
         * \ref PartialModelSaver::add_model() does write the weight files, but it does not yet update the
         * metadata file.
         * \code
         * for(auto& partial_model : generator_of_partial_models) {
         *     saver.add_model(partial_model);
         * }
         * \endcode
         * After all partial models have been added, you should call \ref PartialModelSaver::finalize(). This method
         * first verifies that you have in fact submitted all partial models, i.e. that all together the weight vector
         * for each label has been saved. If that is the case, it updates the metadata file.
         * If you want to checkpoint the models you have saved up to a certain point, but have not yet saved all
         * weights, you can instead use the \ref PartialModelSaver::update_meta_file() function. This will only update
         * the meta-data file, but not check that all weights are present. You can continue writing more partial models
         * to that PartialModelSaver. Another, typical use case is that you want to continue adding to the save file
         * in another run of the program. In that case, you can load the partial save file by passing true as the
         * `load_partial` argument to the constructor.
         * \code
         * saver.update_meta_file();        // model is still incomplete
         * // ...
         * PartialModelSaver continued_save(target_file, options, true);    // load the partial save file
         * continued_save.add_model(missing_parts);                         // add more partial models
         * continued_save.finalize();                                       // call finalize once it is complete.
